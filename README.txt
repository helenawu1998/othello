Helena:
    Coded non-recursive minimax.
    Tested and improved minimax.
Evan:
    Coded random move player.
    Coded heuristic to beat SimplePlayer.
Together:
    Coded recursive minimax.
    Attempted AlphaBeta pruning.

We made the minimax algorithm recursive and determined a best depth of 8.
We assigned optimal scores to the corners and edges of the board.
Our heuristic weighs board position and difference in stone count the same.
We attempted to use alphabeta pruning to minimize computation time.
